# Spotify Clone

This project is a Spotify clone created for the assignment, utilizing React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and JSON data.

**Note:** I apologize for the late submission. Due to personal reasons, I was unavailable on Sunday and had to find time between my working hours to complete this assignment.

## Tasks Completed

- **Spotify-Like Interface**: Mimics the look and feel of the Spotify app for a seamless user experience.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Utilizes JSON data to dynamically render content.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **JSON**: Lightweight data-interchange format for storing playlist, song, and artist information.
